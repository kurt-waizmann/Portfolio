    "title": "About Me",
    "bio1": "My passion for storytelling took me to the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, where I studied film production. There, I wrote and directed my own projects and even got hands-on in the post production process by stepping in as sound designer. Now I hope to apply the invaluable lessons I learned to my journey in web development.",
    "bio2": "I received my education in full stack development — the MERN stack. Personally, I lean more towards front-end development. I often work in React.js and I also have a special fondness for CSS.",
    "bio3": "Wherever I find myself next, I'm excited to take new steps in my journey, collaborate with the people I meet along the way, and explore the endless potential of new web technologies."
