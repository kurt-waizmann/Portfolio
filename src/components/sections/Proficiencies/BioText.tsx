        My passion for storytelling took me to the Mel Hoppenheim School of
        Cinema, where I studied film production. There, I wrote and directed my
        own projects and even got hands-on in the post production process by
        stepping in as sound designer. Now I hope to apply the invaluable
        lessons I learned to my journey in web development.

      <Details style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
        I received my education in full stack development â€” the MERN stack.
        Personally, I lean more towards front-end development. I often work in
        React.js and I also have a special fondness for CSS.

        Wherever I find myself next, I'm excited to take new steps in my
        journey, collaborate with the people I meet along the way, and explore
        the endless potential of new web technologies.
