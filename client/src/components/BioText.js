                I'm fascinated with the possibilities of storytelling using web technologies. Previously, I studied film production at the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema where I dabbled in eveything from sound design, screenwriting, and even directed my own projects. Now I hope to apply those lessons to my journey in web development.
            </Details>
            <Details style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }} >
                I have an education in full stack development â€” the
                <Mern> MERN </Mern>
                stack. But my preferences lean more towards front-end development. I work a lot in React.js and I have a special fondness for CSS.

            <Details style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
                Wherever I find myself next, I'm excited to continue my education, collaborate with new people, and explore new web technologies!
